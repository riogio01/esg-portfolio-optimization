# ESG-Constrained Portfolio Optimization (MIQP)

Efficient-frontier analysis under realistic business rules and an ESG threshold.  
Reproducible pipeline: **data prep → covariance/returns → MIQP frontier → benchmarks (EW/IV) → figures → LaTeX report**.

> Developed during the summer school *“Data Science for Sustainable Finance and Economics”* by a team of five.

## Highlights
- **MIQP formulation** with per-asset bounds, sector caps, cardinality, and a **portfolio-level ESG** threshold.
- **Clean notebooks** for EDA, cleaning, benchmarks, and analysis.
- **Benchmarks**: Equal Weight (EW) and Inverse Volatility (IV).
- **Publication-ready figures** and **LaTeX report** (with appendix tables: holdings, sector exposures, summary).
